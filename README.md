## Technical Overview

**Decentralized Smart Contracts:**  
- Utilizes Ethereum smart contracts to mint NFTs representing licensing rights and to record all licensing agreements.  
- Every transaction is recorded immutably on-chain for full transparency and security.

**Agentic AI Integration:**  
- **Automated Smart Contract Calls:** AI agents trigger minting and licensing actions based on real-time on-chain data without manual intervention.  
- **AI Plagiarism Detection:** The system continuously scans on-chain records to verify the originality of new music submissions, providing rapid and accurate copyright protection.  
- **Dynamic Pricing:** By analyzing live on-chain data and external market inputs (e.g., from Gemini), the AI automatically adjusts NFT pricing to match current market conditions.

## Benefits

- **Fair Revenue Distribution:** Eliminates intermediaries, ensuring that artists receive a larger share of earnings.
- **Transparency and Trust:** Immutable blockchain records provide clear, verifiable histories for each licensing and transaction event.
- **Efficiency and Proactivity:** Autonomous AI agents manage routine tasks, reducing delays and human error while proactively addressing issues like plagiarism.
- **Responsive Market Pricing:** Dynamic pricing continuously reflects actual market demand, unlike the static models used by traditional labels.
